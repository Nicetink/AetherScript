**A modern programming language designed for simplicity, safety, and performance.**

AetherScript is a beginner-friendly language with a clean, Python-like syntax, perfect for learning to code or building simple applications. Inspired by the sleek aesthetics of Visual Studio Code, AetherScript offers an intuitive development experience through its dedicated IDE.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Simple Syntax**: Write clear code with minimal boilerplate using `let` for variables and `print` for output.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` for numerical computations.
- **Lightweight IDE**: Run your `.aether` scripts in the AetherScript IDE, built with Python and PyQt6.
- **Memory Safety**: Designed with safety in mind, inspired by Rust (future goal).
- **Open Source**: Licensed under NSPL, welcoming contributions from the community.

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt6
   ```
2. **Run the IDE**:
   ```bash
   python aetheride.py
   ```
3. **Write Your First Program**:
   ```aether
   // Simple calculator
   let a = 10;
   let b = 5;
   let sum = a + b;
   print("Sum: ");
   print(sum); // Outputs: 15
   ```

- Console output (`print`)
- Single-line comments (`//`)

## üîÆ Roadmap
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions (`fn`)
- User input
