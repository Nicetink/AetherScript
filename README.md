# AetherScript IDE v1.0

A modern programming environment designed for **simplicity**, **safety**, and an exceptional user experience.

**AetherScript** is a beginner-friendly language with a clean, Python-like syntax, perfect for learning to code or prototyping simple applications. Inspired by the sleek aesthetics of Visual Studio Code, the AetherScript IDE v1.0 offers a polished, intuitive development experience, powered by Python and PyQt6.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Simple Syntax**: Write clear `.aether` code using `let` for variables, `print` for output, `if`/`else` for conditionals, and `input` for user interaction.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Vibrant highlighting for keywords (`let`, `print`, `if`, `else`, `input`) in dark (#161b22) and light (#f6f8fa) themes.
- **File Explorer**: Manage files and folders with a QTreeView-based interface, supporting create, rename, and delete operations via right-click menus.
- **Zoom Controls**: Adjust font size (8‚Äì24px) with Ctrl+Mouse Wheel or Ctrl+Plus/Minus for comfortable coding.
- **Themes**: Switch between modern dark and light themes to match your style.
- **Custom Icon**: A stylish #58a6ff icon for the window, taskbar, and About dialog.
- **Safe Execution**: Uses `ast.literal_eval` to prevent code injection, optimized for minimal antivirus false positives (0‚Äì2 detections on VirusTotal).
- **Lightweight IDE**: Built with PyQt6, offering a fast and responsive experience.
- **Installer**: A beautiful Inno Setup installer (`AetherScriptIDE_Setup.exe`) with English/Russian support and optional documentation.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive `AetherScript_Documentation.pdf` included.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under the NSPL, welcoming contributions from the community.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Download the Installer**:
   - [AetherScriptIDE_Setup.exe](https://github.com/Nicetink/AetherScript/releases/tag/aether)
   - Run the installer, choose your language (English/Russian), and select options (Desktop shortcut, documentation).

2. **Run from Source** (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt6==6.7.0 Pillow==10.4.0
   python ide.py
   ```

3. **Write Your First Program**:
   ```aether
   // Simple interactive program
   let name = input("Enter your name: ");
   let age = 25;
   if age > 18 {
       print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to AetherScript!");
   } else {
       print("Hi, " + name + "! You're young!");
   }
   ```

4. Explore the [Documentation](https://github.com/your-username/aether-script/releases/download/v1.0/AetherScript_Documentation.pdf) for detailed guides.

## üåü Current Status

AetherScript IDE v1.0 supports:
- Variables (`let x = 10;`)
- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Console output (`print`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`)
- User input (`input`)
- Single-line comments (`//`)
- Syntax highlighting and file management
- Theme switching and zoom controls

## üîÆ Roadmap
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions (`fn`)
- Structs and modules
- Enhanced debugging tools
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Antivirus Notice
The IDE is compiled with PyInstaller, which may trigger rare false positives in some antivirus software (e.g., Jiangmin, SecureAge). Typically, 0‚Äì2 detections on VirusTotal are expected for unsigned executables. Verify the source code on [GitHub] or run `ide.py` directly.
