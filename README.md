AetherScript v1.0
A modern programming environment designed for simplicity, safety, and an exceptional user experience.
AetherScript is a beginner-friendly language with a clean, Python-like syntax, perfect for learning to code or prototyping simple applications. Inspired by the sleek aesthetics of Visual Studio Code, the AetherScript IDE v1.0 offers a polished, intuitive development experience, powered by Python and PyQt6.
‚ú® Features

Simple Syntax: Write clear .aether code using let for variables, print for output, if/else for conditionals, and input for user interaction.
Syntax Highlighting: Vibrant highlighting for keywords (let, print, if, else, input) in dark (#161b22) and light (#f6f8fa) themes.
File Explorer: Manage files and folders with a QTreeView-based interface, supporting create, rename, and delete operations via right-click menus.
Zoom Controls: Adjust font size (8‚Äì24px) with Ctrl+Mouse Wheel or Ctrl+Plus/Minus for comfortable coding.
Themes: Switch between modern dark and light themes to match your style.
Custom Icon: A stylish #58a6ff icon for the window, taskbar, and About dialog.
Safe Execution: Uses ast.literal_eval to prevent code injection, optimized for minimal antivirus false positives (0‚Äì2 detections on VirusTotal).
Lightweight IDE: Built with PyQt6, offering a fast and responsive experience.
Installer: A beautiful Inno Setup installer (AetherScriptIDE_Setup.exe) with English/Russian support and optional documentation.
Documentation: Comprehensive AetherScript_Documentation.pdf included.
Open Source: Licensed under the NSPL, welcoming contributions from the community.
